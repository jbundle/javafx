Thick screen implementations

The master branch contains the Swing implementation (for now).

This branches contain the JavaFX thick screen view implementation

NOTE: You will find the oracle ensemble example in the 'ensemble' branch. I
don't keep it in the master branch, because it is in maven central.

Note to self: Remember to merge the master branch with ensemble before releasing.
